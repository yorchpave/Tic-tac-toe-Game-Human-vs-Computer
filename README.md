# Tic-tac-toe-Game-Human-vs-Computer

There are 4 files in this project:

  Conector.java, TicTacToe.java, TicTacToe.pl, and Architecture_Document.pdf

To execute the program, Java and Swipl must be installed first. This can be done by visiting the following links:

  Java: https://java.com/en/download/
  
  Swipl: http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html

Once you have installed Java and Swipl, you have to open the TicTacToe.java file and edit lines 138 and 140 by replacing the paths for the Swipl and TicTacToe.pl locations respectively, so they match to your computer's path to those files.

Now you are all set! You can now open your terminal and execute:

  javac TicTacToe.java

To compile the Project, and finally to run it:

  java TicTacToe
